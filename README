Take a look at a current snapshot of webkochbuch, hosted by heroku: http://webkochbuch.herokuapp.com/

To run webkochbuch successfully on your own machine, please remind:
- webkochbuch currently stores its database connection url, username and password in the src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/hibernate.properties
  Please adjust it to your own databasae! IMPORTANT: Don't push the edited file back to the git repository! Use .gitignore or something
  else to prevent that!
- webkochbuch currently works with its old database tables. There is a script called 
  webkochbuch_createtables_experimental.sql to create the corresponding database tables.
- The user of your database which is used by webkochbuch must have the rights to read and write the corresponding tables.
  To achieve that, open a sql command line and type;
  GRANT SELECT on recipes to username;
  GRANT CREATE on recipes to username;
  GRANT DELETE on recipes to username;
  GRANT UPDATE on recipes to username;
  
FUTURE:
- it is planned to make webkochbuch read the database url from an environment variable (also needed for heroku)
- it is planned to port the java code to work with the new database tables
