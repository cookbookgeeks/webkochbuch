Take a look at a current snapshot of webkochbuch, hosted by heroku: http://webkochbuch.herokuapp.com/

IMPORTANT: if you imported code into eclipse before commit 5b8139a134cfe14f53d014811d3c18d5c678f3d6, please remove it, pull the current code base and reimport it into eclipse again. This is caused by a change of the top level package.

USAGE:
1.)
Webkochbuch uses a standard postgresql database to store its data. You can either use the productive database hosted by heroku or you can use a local database
if you run webkochbuch locally. As a consequence, webkochbuch doesn't store the database url in a configuration file but reads it from an environment variable
called DATABASE_URL. To run webkochbuch with a local database, excecute: export DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/webkochbuch
