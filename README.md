### Webkochbuch hosted by heroku
http://webkochbuch.herokuapp.com/

### Run webkochbuch locally

 - webkochbuch currently works with its old database tables. There is a script called 
  webkochbuch_createtables_experimental.sql to create the corresponding database tables.
 - IMPORTANT: Due to the fact that this Version is build to run on heroku and similar platforms, 
  you have to edit line 19 in server.xml of your local spring IDE to make hyperlinks and includes work!   
 - The user of your database which is used by webkochbuch must have the rights to read and write the corresponding tables.
  To achieve that, open a sql command line and type;
  GRANT SELECT on recipes to username;
  GRANT CREATE on recipes to username;
  GRANT DELETE on recipes to username;
  GRANT UPDATE on recipes to username;
 - Follow the instructions of the experimental database script to create a sequence for automatic id incrementation!
 - webkochbuch reads its database url (including username and password) from an environment variable called DATABASE_URL.
  You have to set this environment variable on your local setup to be able to connect to your database.
  
### Future plans

 - it is planned to port the java code to work with the new database tables
